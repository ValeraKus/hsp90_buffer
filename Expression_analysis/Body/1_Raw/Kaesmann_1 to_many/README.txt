These supplementary datasets provide the expression levels for Ensembl-annotated genes. The expression level presented here is the mean per-base read coverage for each gene (N.B.: this expression level measurement is different from the RPKM, but RPKM values can be easily deduced from the mean per-base read coverage, if needed). The mean per-base read coverage was computed on Ensembl-annotated exons, with unambiguously mapping reads, as provided by TopHat (version 1.0.13). N.B. The expression values provided in these files are NOT NORMALIZED.

The annotations used here come from Ensembl release 57. For protein-coding genes, only exons belonging to protein-coding transcripts (to the exclusion of "retained_intron" or "processed_transcript" biotypes, for example) were taken into account for the estimation of gene expression levels. For non-protein-coding genes, all transcripts were considered. 

There is one file per species, for example Human_Ensembl57_TopHat_UniqueReads.txt. The columns are tab-separated, and there are column headers. In addition to gene expression levels for each sample, these files have 6 columns which contain for each gene the Ensembl identifier, the chromosome name, the start and end position, the strand and the exonic length.

In addition, we provide two files which contain the Ensembl identifiers for the two sets of 1-1 orthologues (Ortho_1to1_AllSpecies.txt and Ortho_1to1_Primates.txt). We also provide a list of genes that have significant overlap with neighboring genes (and for which the expression level estimates are likely to be more uncertain) for the two sets of orthologoues (GenesWithOverlap_1to1Ortho_AllSpecies.txt and GenesWithOverlap_1to1Ortho_Primates.txt).
